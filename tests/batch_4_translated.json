These attention scores, calculated for each head, provide insight into the significance of different patches with one another (Table 1). Upon examination, the attention model demonstrates a notable focus on relevant peaks within the spectra. The attention model accurately identifies the strong absorption bands associated with the alcohol functional group, particularly at 3600 cm−1 . However, for groups such as alkane and methyl, whose absorption bands overlap within the 2800−3000 cm−1 range, the attention transformer detects these features less prominently, reflecting their weaker signals. Moreover, the prominent peak observed at 1700−1750 cm−1 , revealing ester stretching vibrations and potentially carboxylic acid groups, receives significant attention from the model.",
