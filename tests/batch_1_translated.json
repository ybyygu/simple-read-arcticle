These computer models are trained to extract features from raw data and make predictions and classifications. DL models can be trained in chemistry to predict the presence or absence of specific functional groups in chemical compounds based on IR spectra.18 This is particularly useful when dealing with complex spectra with multiple overlapping peaks.19 Recently, several studies were reported using DL models to investigate the IR spectra. The most successful and efficient model presented in this field is the convolutional neuron network (CNN) or CNN-based model,18−27 recognized for its remarkable efficacy in predicting functional groups. However, evaluating these models solely based on functional group prediction precision may lead to an incomplete assessment. It is imperative to also consider the accuracy of the model in predicting entire molecules. This consideration arises from data imbalance issues, where certain functional groups are more prevalent than others within the data set. To illustrate, if a molecule comprises five functional groups and a model accurately predicts four out of the five, conventional accuracy metrics may suggest an 80% success rate. However, from the perspective of predicting the entire molecule, the accuracy would be 0%.

To ensure uniformity, all spectra were standardized to a consistent set of feature points (3600 points spanning the range from 400 to 4000 cm−1 \n) by employing the linear interpolation method, as defined in eq 1. The spectra data concerning the number of functional groups that existed in each molecule were also investigated. The maximum number of functional groups in a single molecule is seven, and the distribution of each group reveals an imbalance, as illustrated in Figure S1A−C. Spectra were then segmented into seven groups to address this imbalance. This method ensures that models are trained and evaluated on data sets accurately representing the distribution of functional groups, thereby promoting a more balanced data set regarding the number of functional groups per molecule.51 Subsequently, all groups were randomly partitioned into training, validation, and test sets with allocation ratios of 75, 15, and 10%, respectively.
